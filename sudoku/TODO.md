# Sudoku

This is Sudoku implemented in JS, as a reference for studying relevant algorithms.

Here are my main goals:

- An encoder/decoder that can compress a sudoku board as _small as possible_.
- Shortest possible code for generating acceptable Sudoku puzzles. 16-bit seed (65536 possible puzzles).
- Valdiating a Sudoku board, and giving it color for givens or invalids, etc.
- No support for "notes" in the save data, unless it can be optimized heavily.

### TODO

1. Sudoku state validation
2. Simple user experience improvements. _(maybe)_ Click cells to cycle through numbers (Left and Right click - arrow
   keys as well?)
