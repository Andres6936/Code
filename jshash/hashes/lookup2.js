/*
    Jenkins lookup2
    ---------------
    Jenkins lookup2 hash implemented by bryc (github.com/bryc)
    Outputs 32-bit hash.

    Like lookup3, a,b,c can combine to produce 64 or 96-bit hash.
    However a and b seem to have lower quality collision resistance
    and distribution, resulting in a weaker 64-bit or 96-bit hash.

    This is explored in a paper (Chapter 4.1 Getting the most from Jenkins)
    "Although the word returned is the only one that satisfies certain properties
    that can be tested in Jenkinsâ€™ lookup2.c [12], we have found that for our purposes,
    extracting all three words from a single run of Jenkins is about as good as calling
    the function three times."
